# koishibot
Just another personal Twitchbot 😅

The whole reason I started learning how to code was to make my own Twitch Bot!\
*"But Elysia, wouldn't it be easier to use any number of the currently existing bots?"* you say - well sure I could and did for a long time!\
However I wanted to do some very specific workflows that I finally decided to make my own bot than manage multiple apps for a stream.

That being said, this isn't a public bot to use on other channels - sorry, it wasn't built with general use in mind 🫠\
There are a lot of hardcoded data/specific features that I can't imagine other streamers needing\
...as well as bugs that I don't want to be responsible for 🐌\
BUT I did make this project public so others can take a peek to see how features are done and take inspiration for their own Twitch projects.

Koishibot is my first application (because I couldn't just start with something small!) so expect some spaghetti or code that can be improved on.\
As this is a personal learning project, I'm not looking for contributors or accepting pull releases, although I appreciate the offers!\
You're welcome to point out code I could improve on but don't take it personally if I don't take it on board 💜\
A huge thank you to my Twitch community who have pointed me in the right direction or helped when I got stuck on a bug 😅

Some little tidbits:\
Originally started out as a WPF project in Nov 2022 before pivoting to a web app in Spring 2024\
Uses Vue & Tailwind for the Frontend, ASP.NET for the Backend\
EFCore & Mariadb for the Database\
Inspired by Vertical Slice Architecture because I hate jumping between a bazillion files

🐍 *In memory of BraveCobra, who took the time to teach this bby coder about application architecture. Fuck Cancer.*
